Google Sheets as a database or tiny CMS

Do you want to use Google Sheets as a database for websites? 
Here you can find a working example that is compatible with the current Google API v4 (2021). 
There is a search for the results and a filter by category

Since <a href="">tabletop.js</a> is dead, I had to look for a new solution to use data from Google Sheets via JSON in websites. 
The holy grail in this case is Papaparse.js, but my old solution in combination with isotope.js only worked after further modifications to the code.
