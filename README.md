<h1>Google Sheet as database or tiny CMS using Papa Parse (with quick search and filter by category using isotope)<h1>

Do you want to use Google Sheets as a database for websites? 
Here you can find a working example that is compatible with the current Google API v4 (2021). 
There is a search for the results and a filter by category

Since <a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">tabletop.js</a> is dead, I had to look for a new solution to use data from Google Sheets via JSON in websites. 
The holy grail in this case is <a href="https://www.papaparse.com">Papa Parse</a>, but my old solution in combination with <a href="https://isotope.metafizzy.co">isotope.js</a> only worked after further modifications to the code.
